Modified Dual boot (serial/usb) bootloader from Multiprotocl 4in1 to work with the 1st generation IrangeX pro 4in1 module 
that did not have the  usb port.  This version has a defect in the inverter that only allows it to work with inverted comms.
This bootloader also fixes the issue with some modules not booting correctly in the taranis.
