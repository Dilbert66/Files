Modified Dual boot (serial/usb) bootloader from the Multiprotocol 4in1 project to work with the 1st generation IrangeX pro 4in1 module 
that did not have the  usb port.  This version has a defect in the inverter that only allows it to work with inverted comms.
This bootloader also fixes the issue with some modules not booting correctly in the taranis. The source for the bootloader comes from Mike's repository at: https://github.com/MikeBland/StmDualBoot.

To use, you will need to insure you select inverted comm as YES in the flashing application.
